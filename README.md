# Content-based-Image-Retrieval

This project focuses on advancing skills in manipulaHng and analyzing images at the pixel level,
with a specific emphasis on matching and paNern recogniHon. It involves developing a system
that, given a database of images and a target image, idenHfies images within the database that
share similar content. UHlizing both classic image features—such as color, texture, and spaHal
layout—and deep network embeddings derived from a ResNet18 network, the project offers
hands-on experience with various aspects of image analysis.
